# How to run the Night Kernel

Running the kernel is pretty easy, as long as you follow the intructions below.

### Step 1 - Obtain a Copy of the kernel iso or image

If you built the kernel from scratch, then you should already have an ISO

Otherwise you can get the latest release from github releases.

### Step 2 - Installing the image (or ISO)

**Note: If you want to run the ISO an emaluator, skip to step 3**

To install the iso or image, proceed to the next subsection

#### If you have an ISO

If you have an ISO, then the steps are pretty straight foreward.

You can simply burn the ISO to a cd (or a flash drive using [Rufus](rufus.ie))

#### If you have a .zip image

This is a little bit more complicated. Format the Drive that you will install to (FAT32).

Then, unzip the image in the root directory of the freshly formatted drive.

### Step 3 - Running the kernel

If you are on an emalulator, boot the iso image or the drive with the EFI image.

It is up to you to boot the kernel as for emaluators have diffrent ways of doing things.

If you are on real hardware, it is as simple as UEFI booting your drive, if you used the .zip image
Or BIOS booting the drive, if you used the ISO.

This is the end of the tutorial, hope you enjoy trying the kernel on real hardware!
